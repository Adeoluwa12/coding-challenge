###  Introduction
The Telemedicine app is a web application that connects patients and doctors through appointment chats and calls. It aims to simplify the process of building web applications for telemedicine and make it easier for patients to access healthcare services remotely.





### Features
The Telemedicine app has the following features:

Authentication
The app supports authentication for doctors and patients. Doctors and patients can create accounts, log in, and log out. The app also includes password reset functionality if a user forgets their password.

Rating System
The app includes a rating system for doctors. Patients can rate their experience with a doctor after an appointment, and the doctor's overall rating is calculated based on all the ratings they receive.

Appointment Booking
The app has an appointment booking system that allows patients to book appointments with doctors. Patients can see a list of available doctors, view their schedules, and book an appointment for a specific date and time.

Video Calls
The app includes a video call feature that allows doctors and patients to have a video consultation. The video call is initiated from the app and can be accessed by both parties through a secure link.

Chat
The app also includes a chat feature that allows doctors and patients to communicate via text messages. The chat feature is integrated with the appointment booking system and allows doctors and patients to communicate before and after the appointment.

The Telemedicine app is built using the following technologies:

Node.js: The server-side runtime environment for the app
Express.js: The web framework used for building the API
MongoDB: The database used for storing data
Socket.io: The library used for real-time communication
